# Day 5

Day 5 notes for the advent of code

## Part 1

So we have first ranges of fresh ingredients and then we get list that we need to check if they are fresh or spoiled.

I first make a tuple with ranges and then list of numbers that need to be checked. Then check those numbers between each other.

## Part 2

This just needs to make a list of all the ranges and then count them.
