# Day 3 Notes

Notes for day 3 of advent of code

## Part 1

The banks are lines of digits and I need to find the largest possible joltage each bank can produce and sum it together. 

First idea picked up the max and second largest number but then I read the task more and realised the largest number isn't max + secondmax but instead need to make the numbers into pairs and compare them to each other

## Part 2

The part 2 needs a combination of 12 numbers. At first it doesn't sound too difficult, but I need to change the functionality a bit.

Required some googling but I went to the approach that I have a number stack that always compares the last number to current number at the end of the list.
